    <p1>Early life and education</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Plains,_New_York" target="_blank">White Plains, New York</a> to psychiatrist Karen (née Kempner) and
    dentist Edward Zuckerberg.He and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were raised in a Reform Jewish
    household in Dobbs Ferry, New York.His great-grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Austria, Germany, and
    Poland.Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy. He was
    captain of the fencing team

    <br>
    <p3>Early years</p3>
    <br>
    
    <p>Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. In high school, he built a program that allowed
       all the computers between his house and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.During
       Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called <a href="https://www.geeknaut.com/synapse-media-player-mark-zuckerbergs-music-app-04191641.html" target="_blank">the Synapse Media Player</a>
       The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot and received a rating of 3 out
       of 5 from PC Magazine. The New Yorker once said of Zuckerberg: "some kids played computer games. Mark created them.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <p4>College years</p4>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/" target="_blank">New Yorker</a> noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation
       as a programming prodigy".
    </p>
    
    <p>He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Epsilon_Pi" target="_blank"Alpha_Epsilon_Pi>Alpha_Epsilon_Pi</a> and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkland_House" target="_blank">Kirkland_House</a> House.In his second
       year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the
       choices of other students and help them form study groups.
    </p>

    <p>Later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from
       a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained:
    </p>
    
    <p>We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At
       first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to
       choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.
    </p>
    
    <p>The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed
       one of Harvard's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch" target="_blank">Network_switch</a> preventing students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained
       that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles
       stating that his site was "completely improper".
