      <h4>College years</h4>
      <p class="description">The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation
      as a programming prodigy" He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland
      House.In his second year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch,which allowed users to make class
      selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups. Later, he created a
      different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos.

      <br>An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter
      Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, "The Photo
      Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the
      student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class
      years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.</p>
