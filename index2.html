      <h4>In Canada</h4>
      <p class="description">In Canada, land acknowledgments became more popular after the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission report (which
      argued that the country's Indian residential school system had amounted to cultural genocide) and the election of a
      Liberal majority led by Justin Trudeau that same year. By 2019, they were a regular practice at events including
      National Hockey League games, ballet performances, and parliament meetings.</p>

      <h4>In United States</h4>
      <p class="description">In the United States, the practice of land acknowledgments has been gaining momentum as well. Early adopters included
      arts institutions, museums, institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, local governments, and
      churches.After the 2020 Oscar land acknowledgment statement by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taika_Waititi" target="_blank">Taika Waititi</a>
, the practice has received more attention,
      both positively and negatively. Native Governance Center has resources on the topic of land acknowledgment, as do a
      number of sites geared toward colleges and universities.

      <h4>Facebook</h4>
      <p class="description">In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website. On February 4, 2004,
        Zuckerberg launched
        "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates <br>

        <br>An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter
        Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, "The
        Photo
        Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of
        the
        student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as
        their class
        years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.
